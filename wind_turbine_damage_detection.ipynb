        "# Wind Turbine Blade Damage Detection with YOLOv8\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This project was developed as a final undergraduate thesis and aims to detect damages on wind turbine blades using the YOLOv8 computer vision model. A custom dataset was created with images of a mini wind turbine, where damages were simulated using stickers. Additionally, data augmentation was performed in external software to increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Train a YOLOv8 model to identify and classify damages on wind turbine blades using an annotated dataset in the YOLO format.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "1. **Data Collection**: Photographs of a mini wind turbine with simulated damages (stickers).\n",
        "2. **Annotation**: Images were annotated in the YOLO format using annotation software.\n",
        "3. **Data Augmentation**: Application of data augmentation techniques (rotations, flips, brightness adjustments, etc.) in external software.\n",
        "4. **Training**: Training the YOLOv8 model with the prepared dataset.\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**: Analysis of the trained model's results on a test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Structure\n",
        "The dataset is organized as follows:\n",
        "- `train/`: Training images and their annotations.\n",
        "- `valid/`: Validation images and their annotations.\n",
        "- `test/`: Test images and their annotations.\n",
        "- `data.yaml`: Configuration file with dataset paths and classes.\n"
